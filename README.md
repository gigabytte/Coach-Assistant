Record.  Analyse.  Perform.

Coach Assistant: Ice Hockey is an intuitive and easy to use hockey stats recording app built with rich analytical support so you (a coach) can take your players performance to the top. The app features an easy to use Ice Surface that allows for the placement of Shots, Goals, Penalties and much much more! Coach Assistant not only allows you to record your hockey games with ease but playing them back and viewing live and old game stats is effortless.
